# 🎸 Weezer

A modern **full-stack social platform** built with a production-first mindset.

Dockerized architecture with real-time communication, authentication, cloud-ready services, and clean service separation.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Run the entire system:
```bash
docker compose up -d
This starts all services:

backend

frontend

mysql

localstack

sockets

Run a single service:

bash
Copy code
docker compose up backend
docker compose up frontend
docker compose up mysql
docker compose up localstack
🐳 Docker & Configuration
All environment variables and ports are defined in docker-compose.yml

Each service has its own Dockerfile:

/backend

/frontend

/io

/database

Services communicate internally using Docker service names (not localhost)
