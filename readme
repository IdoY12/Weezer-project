# 🎸 Weezer

A modern full-stack social platform built with a production-first mindset.

Dockerized architecture with real-time communication, authentication, cloud-ready services, and clean service separation.

---

Quick Start

Run the entire system:

docker compose up -d

This starts all services:
- backend
- frontend
- mysql
- localstack
- sockets

Run a single service:

docker compose up backend
docker compose up frontend
docker compose up mysql
docker compose up localstack

---

Docker & Configuration

- All environment variables and ports are defined in docker-compose.yml
- Each service has its own Dockerfile (backend, frontend, io, database)
- Services communicate internally using Docker service names (not localhost)
